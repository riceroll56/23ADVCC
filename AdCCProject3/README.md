Design Process
- I started with creating an outline of what I wanted the questions to be and I created a basis on how I wanted them to be organized
- I knew I wanted to do four answers to each question, and each answer would be associated with a different persona
- On Adobe Illustrator, I created four different cards to reflect the gamer archetypes.
- Then I began coding my website--using black, white, and red to reference playing cards.
- I wanted to include percentages in the final result because no one is one type of video gamer.
Inspiration and References
- After that, I did some research on different video gamer personas there are
- In the 1990s, Dr Richard Bartle describes 4 different personas: The Killer, The Achiever, The Socializer, and The Explorer
- Based off of his research, I decided to create a quiz that reflects these personas--using card suits to emphasize game theme.
- For coding assistance, I used the resources you provided as well as a quiz called Cosmo Persona.
Challenges
- One challenge I had was the coding and math of how to display the percentages. I utilized arrays to figure it out.
- Beginnng with adding the scores then dividing by the total score *100
- It was also difficult to get the percentages to appear largest to smallest.
Next Steps
- I want to add animated gifs and motion graphics in the background
- I also wanted to make the card flippable through a button, but I ran out of time.
